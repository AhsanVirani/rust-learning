# 🦀 Rust Language Learning Journey

Welcome to my Rust learning repository! This project is a structured deep dive into the Rust programming language, based on a long-form course that covers everything from the basics of variables to advanced topics like lifetimes, traits, and iterators.

Each folder in `repos/` corresponds to a set of topics covered in the course. Code examples, notes, and experiments are included along the way.
